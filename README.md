## Overview
### Description

Platform creates a community for users to share their thoughts about the TV shows and movies they have playing on their screens without having to leave the comfort of their room. With comment threads operating in real-time, users are guranteed the opportunity to discuss what happened just moments ago. An unexpected plot twist, the death of the character everyone fell in love with, and even theories about what will happen after the out-of-nowhere cliffhanger -- this is the platform to share it all and from other users as well. Furthermore, users are given a continuous feed of trending titles based upon their filter-selection. This feed is great not only for those times when users just want something new to watch, but also helpful for other users. With the up and down-voting feature for each title, which include the option to provided keywords to describe the title, other users are guranteed a more accurate viewing of trending titles.


### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social / Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Mobile makes it a convience to engage with fellow users and view trending material without the nuisance of dealing with a desktop. App actions (i.e voting and chating) become easier while push-notifications keep user up-to-date regarding titles, communities, and more. 
- **Story:** After watching something, whether a short clip or a 2-hour movie, most people have some thoughts and questions about it. To address this, certain platforms (i.e YouTube) have a comment section. However, for many entertainment platforms (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), there is no such thing, forcing many viewers to keep these thoughts and questions to themself or scrolling online. Platform changes all of that as it gives user a space to share their thought, ask questions, and simply engage with one another.
- **Market:** As the purpose of the app is to act as a community for media watchers, the number of users potentially runs large in relation to that audience size. Wouldn't say there is a huge value, but the app does carry worth for the abundance of viewers who would like a clearly dedicated comment section for their TV shows and movies.
- **Habit:** Considering that this app is a companian to media, it could be opened many times throughout the day by a single user. That said, a more 'reasonable' expection could 3-5 during a week. The average user has the opportunity to both consume and create content on the app, thus making it more engageable and possibly increasing how often they open the app.
- **Scope:** The app will be just the right level of challenging for the most foundational features of the app (commenting, rating, etc.). Adding additional features could possible pose a challenging depending on the feature and how I want to implement it (i.e sorting algorithms). That said, the stripped-down version of the app which includes the foundational features would still be worth building.
